This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Project Title: Cycorp Trial

#### Description
Cycorp Trial is a web application built using Next.js, designed to demonstrate the framework's capabilities in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The project showcases various Next.js features such as dynamic routing, API routes, and pre-rendering, providing a robust and scalable solution for modern web development.

#### Features
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Efficiently renders pages on the server for better SEO and initial load performance.
 - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-renders pages at build time for fast delivery and improved performance.
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Demonstrates the use of dynamic routing to create flexible and scalable page structures.
  - **API Routes:** Includes API endpoints to handle server-side logic and data fetching.

#### Project Structure
- **pages/:** Contains Next.js pages for routing.
- **public/:** Static files and assets.
- **components/:** Reusable React components.
- **styles/:** CSS stylesheets.
- **api/:** API routes for server-side logic.
- **utils/:** Utility functions and helpers.

## Run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
