This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Project Overview
Cycorp Trial is a web application built using Next.js, demonstrating the framework's capabilities in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The project aims to showcase Next.js features such as dynamic routing, API routes, and pre-rendering. It includes components, pages, and API endpoints to illustrate how a Next.js application can be structured and developed for efficient and scalable web solutions.

Features:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Efficiently renders pages on the server for better SEO and initial load performance.
Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-renders pages at build time for fast delivery and improved performance.
Dynamic Routing: Demonstrates the use of dynamic routing to create flexible and scalable page structures.
API Routes: Includes API endpoints to handle server-side logic and data fetching, demonstrating Next.js's capabilities to create full-stack applications.
